#Recent change notes

###0.2.11

- Strong mode compliance.

###0.2.8

- Fix bad type in _Connection class

###0.2.7

- Minor changes, commented out code removed
- Big chunk of tests was commented out in 0.2.6 by error. All tests restored. 

###0.2.6

- update for new sdk (with 1.17.0 [MongoMessageHandler] was broken in checked mode)
- upgrade to current version of `crypto` package, and it's new (Converter based) API 

###0.2.5+1

- Fixed markdown for pub.

###0.2.5

- Moved mongo_dart project to a new organization on [GitHub](https://github.com/mongo-dart/mongo_dart).
- Authentication schemes now use Secure Random coming from `dart:math` since 1.14. ** Note that this version now
required SDK version >= 1.14 because of this **
- Added sort by text score to the query builders.

###0.2.5-beta

- SCRAM-SHA1 authentication scheme added by Joel Trottier-Hebert. Random string (salt) is generated
 with standard dart Random, which is not cryptographically strong for now, hence beta marker on version.  
 Secure Random is due in the next version of SDK, so that would be improved soon.
- SCRAM-SHA1 scheme used as a default while driver is connected to mongodb 3.0, MONGODB_CR used otherwise. 
 `authMechanism` connection string option can be used to override these defaults.
- `authSource` connection string option added See: https://github.com/vadimtsushko/mongo_dart/issues/72
- Many refactorings in tests and code with async/await done by Joel Trottier-Hebert
- Dependency on `logging` package loosen to >=0.9.1 <0.12.0  

###0.2.4

###0.2.3

- Swithed to travis from drone.io
- Can use null-aware operators in example (blog)

###0.2.2

- Loosening parameter type in CursorStream in accordance with sdk 1.13.0
- README update with basic usage

###0.2.1

  - Fix issue [71](https://github.com/vadimtsushko/mongo_dart/issues/71) - Logger allocates lot of strings


###0.2.0

- Breaking change: DbCollection `find` method now returns Stream<Map> instead of Cursor. 
  Cursor have had compatible with Stream<Map> `toList` and `forEach` quite some time already, so in case you used these methods only,
  you should be covered. On the other hand if you used `find().stream` to get a stream it is not valid anymore. In that case you
  should change your code to plain `find()`
- Breaking change: This version use upgraded version of `bson`. `ObjectId.toJson` now converts `ObjectId` to simple hex string representation.
  Earlier it was something like `ObjectId('a29d3ae24...aa')` New behaviour would be more useful when you serialize `bson` map to json be default
  conversion. With new behaviour serialized ObjectId value could be passed to `ObjecdId.parse` method.
  But if your code currently depends on old behaviour (if you now use something like `id.substring(10, 34)` to get hex part of the 
  string representation, you should change your code.

###0.1.47
